Now one of the bugs we might have encountered is if we clicked this button many times and we go through lots of 
different words,you see immediately, that card actually flipped.And it's because that window after three seconds is 
counting down in the background, waiting, waiting, until three seconds at which point it's going to flip the card.
It doesn't care that we've actually just gone onto a new card and we want to wait again, three seconds due to this
it will show the wrong translation and not what we expect infact it will show the translation of very first word when
we start clicking on it. 
In order to get this to work, we will use after_cancel() which will stop the previous timer until we fully wait for 
3 seconds for a particular French word.
Now It's not going to flip until we land on a card and wait for three seconds before it flips.
